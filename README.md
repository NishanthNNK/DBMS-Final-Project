## Project Title
Authenticity in Sentiment: Machine Learning Approach to Differentiating Genuine from Malicious Yelp Reviews

## Project Type
Our project is a multifaceted endeavor that encompasses elements of both Database Translation and a Custom Project.

Database Translation Component: At its foundation, our project involves a substantial element of database translation. We are taking the Yelp dataset, which is in a denormalized JSON format, and restructuring it into a relational schema suitable for SQL storage. This restructuring is critical for enabling the advanced analytics and machine learning components that follow.

Custom Project Component: Beyond the database translation, our project extends into a custom scope that involves the application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify genuine versus malicious reviews. This aspect includes feature engineering, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, user behavior analysis, and the deployment of a predictive model in a real-time environment.

## Dataset Description

Our project utilizes the Yelp dataset, which is a collection of data from Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user interactions. The dataset offers a real-world glimpse into the dynamics of customer feedback across various metropolitan areas in the United States and Canada. 

Yelp Reviews Dataset Utilization:
The dataset includes a comprehensive collection of 6,990,280 reviews, offering valuable insights into customer experiences and sentiments. Our project will leverage this vast repository of user-generated content to differentiate genuine reviews from potentially malicious ones. By focusing solely on the textual content of these reviews, we aim to apply natural language processing techniques and machine learning models to discern authentic feedback from deceptive entries.
